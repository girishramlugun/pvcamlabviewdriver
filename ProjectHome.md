The goal of this open source software project is to allow LabVIEW users access PVCAM (Photometrics Virtual Camera Access Method) features. The driver is coupled with G image
manipulation library


We are grateful to the National Institute of Health for funding support.

as of 8/11/08 I am waiting for the copyright clearance from my boss and the university.

as of 12/1/08 I am getting multiple e-mails as to when I release the drivers. First of all, guys, I would like to thank you for your support. Second thing is that I am working
with the copyright office. Had I known it would take so much time to get the permission to release things to public for free, I would have never done it under university + NIH funding.

as of 12/2/08 In order to use the drivers you will need VIPM from JKI software (http://jkisoft.com/vipm/) and gimagemanipulation library (another by-product of my phd thesis http://code.google.com/p/gimagemanipulationlibrary/)

In the meantime I can be contacted as mzu2006    **at**     gmail.com
